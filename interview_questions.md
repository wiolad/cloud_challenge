# Interview prep üìö

### Week 1

#### What is Cloud Computing?
On-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user
Cloud providers manage the data centers and create services for you that you can access online.

#### What is the Shared Responsibility model?

**AWS responsibility** ‚ÄúSecurity of the Cloud‚Äù: Protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.
**Customer responsibility** ‚ÄúSecurity in the Cloud‚Äù: Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects


#### What are the most popular Cloud Providers?
* Google Cloud Platform
* Amazon Web Services
* Microsoft Azure
* Alibaba Cloud

#### What is a Virtual Machine?
https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-virtual-machine#section-1
A virtual machine (VM) is a digital version of a physical computer. Virtual machine software can run programs and operating systems, store data, connect to networks, and do other computing functions, and requires maintenance such as updates and system monitoring.


### Week 2

#### What is Google Cloud Storage?
A service for storing your objects in Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format. You store objects in containers called **buckets**. All buckets are associated with a project, and you can group your projects under an organization. Each project, bucket, and object in Google Cloud is a resource in Google Cloud. An example of a resource is a bucket.

#### Additional info about Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?
GCP resource hierarchy has four levels: organization, folder, project, and resource. Certain settings can be applied at different levels. The settings are inherited, which means e.g. that if project A belongs to an organization X and someone has been granted access to organization X as admin, they will be also able to manage project A.

#### What is HTML?
HTML - HyperText Markup Language- it is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

#### What is IAM?
IAM - Identity and Management - it lets administrators authorise who can access different resources in the cloud or perform certain actions.


### Week 3

#### What is Python?
My favourite programming language :)

#### What is function?
A piece of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times. A function can take some arguments, make some actions on the arguments and return some value.

#### What is Cloud Function?
With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that can be triggered when an event being watched is fired. The code executes in a fully managed environment. There is no need to provision any infrastructure or worry about managing any servers.

#### What is serverless achitecture?
It is a way to build and run applications and services without the need to manage infrastructure. The application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by a Cloud Provider. You no longer have to provision, scale, and maintain servers to run your applications, databases, and storage systems.

#### What is logging and log monitoring?
Logging - It is referring either to the practice of logging errors and changes, or to the application logs that are collected. The purpose of logging is to create an ongoing record of application events. Log files can be used to review any event within a system, including failures and state transformations. Consequently, log messages can provide valuable information to help pinpoint the cause of performance problems. Log data can help DevOps teams troubleshoot issues by identifying which changes resulted in error reporting. But remember, logging is only as valuable as the information it contains.

Log monitoring - is the process of continuously monitoring logs for specific events or patterns in order to identify potential issues or problems. DevOps and Developers continuously observe logs as they‚Äôre recorded, and further, they employ log monitoring tools to collect, examine, and comprehend network performance data.
